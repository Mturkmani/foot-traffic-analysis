## Overview
The Retail Foot Traffic Analysis App is a user-friendly Streamlit application designed to demonstrate how AI and data analytics can be applied to retail foot traffic data to provide actionable insights. The app allows users to either upload their own foot traffic data or simulate data for analysis. Key functionalities include exploratory data analysis (EDA), hotspot identification through clustering algorithms, and foot traffic forecasting using time series models.

## Features
- Data Upload or Simulation: Upload your own foot traffic data in CSV format or simulate realistic foot traffic data within the app.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate time series plots, summary statistics, and distribution plots to understand the data better.
- Hotspot Analysis: Identify customer hotspots within the retail space using clustering algorithms like KMeans.
- Foot Traffic Forecasting: Forecast future foot traffic using Facebook Prophet, incorporating yearly and weekly seasonality.
- Interactive Visualizations: Utilize Plotly and Seaborn for interactive and insightful data visualizations.
